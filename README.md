# SuperSimpleSolarEclipsePlotter

11/1/2021 Update: I have rewritten a bit of the program so that what it plots to is more reliable of a program. Right now, the range in which it is plotting the solar eclipse is to wide, meaning points that its plotting arent in the actual trajectory of the solar eclipse, so I need to keep working on this to refine the path.

An incredibly simple program that plots solar eclipse trajectories onto a map. An example of what it produces is attached below, which is applying to the solar eclipse planned for October 14th in 2023,

And the actual trajectory from timeanddate.com is,

In order to use it in its current form, I was entering the specific time ranges it should look in between in order to generate plots that are better and more accurate looking. This program still needs work, but its not terrible where it is right now.
